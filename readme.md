# Prototyping FTW

This is a practical talk about why you should prototype early and often, how a prototype will help your team make decisions faster, and how to pick the best prototype for the job. The main takeaways are:

* The importance of a prototype in driving design decisions
* Low-fi, hi-fi, and everything in betweenâ€“ how to choose the right fidelity and tools
* When you should prototype in code
