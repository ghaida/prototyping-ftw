            I'm going to tell you a story about failing. Anyone here ever foster a pet? It's great you should try it out. Fostering a pet is a lot like prototyping. You try something out, you learn, then you figure out if this cat is the right pet solution for your team. I tried fostering a 7-year old tortie a few months ago. It did not go well.

            The cat, whom I will not name to protect her future adoption prospects, was not the right pet solution for my team. This was my realization while I was in the emergency room three days later. We just didn't work out. What was great was that I discovered this before I had committed any further emotional or financial investment to try to make it work. The experiment failed, and I moved on to something else.
